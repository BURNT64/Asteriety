# Asteriety 🚀
*A roguelite arcade defense game built in Unity.*

## 🎮 Concept
You command a stationary ship defending planets from incoming waves of asteroids.  
Rotate to aim, shoot to survive, and collect debris to craft temporary or persistent upgrades.  
Every 5th wave escalates into a boss encounter with unique mechanics.
